## NOTE
This Django project which is a Note app is similar to the previous project (Todo-App) and both have common things. Still, in this project, I learned a lot
of things for example how URLs and views work and also how to style forms using the library Django-widget-tweaks besides that I created this project based
on Django documentation which was one of the simplest documentation I have ever seen before. finally, in this project, I have gained some good knowledge
about Django and corrected some of my mistakes about this framework.
